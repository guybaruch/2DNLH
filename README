for collapsing optical beams, as published in:

Permission is granted to use or modify the code freely, but without any
warranty. If this code was used to aid a scientific publication, please cite
our JCP and Optics Express papers above.


The repository contains four directories:
./run  An empty directory holding the results of a run.
./freezing_nlh  Holding a reference implementation of the freezing-iteration
schemes. The reader may benefit from understanding this simpler code before
the more involved Newton code. 
./newton  Holding the Newton solver, including the Jacobian and iteration code.
./shared  Holding shared code between the fixed-point freezing method and the 
Newton solver. Mostly definitions of the linear operator, and some utils.
./shared/longitudinal  Holding definition of the longitudinal Laplacian
./shared/transverse  Holding definition of the transverse Laplacian

The code stores all parameters, variables and operators in the global structure
T.
To run the freezing code: cd to the freezing_nlh subdir and run the matlab
routine freezing_NLH.
To run the Newton code: cd to the newton subdirectory, optionally modify run
parameters at the file newton_params.m, and run the matlab routine newton_NLH.
See the code for explanation of the different parameters.
